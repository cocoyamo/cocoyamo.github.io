üß† Hello! I am a research technician in [**Frohlich Lab**](https://www.frohlichlab.org/) at UNC Chapel Hill, with a research focus on **cognitive neuroscience**. I am particularly interested in **emotions, memory, and problem-solving**, utilizing **fMRI, EEG, EKG, and GSR** to investigate these cognitive processes. 

Previously, I conducted research across multiple labs:
- At the **Brain, Emotion, and Decision-Making Lab** with Dr. Nai-Shing Yen, I explored the **effects of color-emotion congruency on trust** and the impact of **gamification on motivation**.
- At the [**Brain and Learning Lab**](https://bnlnccu.wixsite.com/bnlnccu/home) under Dr. Ting-Ting Chang's supervision, I investigated **neural activation during math problem-solving**, gaining experience in conducting and analyzing fMRI experiments.
- In Dr. Hanna Steinunn Steingr√≠msd√≥ttir's **EEG lab**, I studied the **neural mechanisms of abstract symbol learning**, conducting EEG experiments on cognitive learning processes. 

üë©‚Äçüéì I obtained my bachelor's degree in Psychology in 2024 from [National ChengChi University](https://www.nccu.edu.tw/index.php?Lang=en), Taiwan, with a year of study abroad experience at [Reykjavik University](https://en.ru.is/), Iceland. 

üßù‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I am currently creating a [tutorial website](https://cocoyamo.github.io/R_tutorials/) for RStudio, focusing on data analysis and visualization. I'm also producing [instructional videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrnPgbLdSy7czQs7mrJNR9XQxH75OjvcU) to guide users step-by-step. My goal is to make learning RStudio more approachable and enjoyable.
