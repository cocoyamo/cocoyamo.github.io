üß† **Hello I'm Moya ü¶¶!**  
I am a research technician in [**Neurocognition and Imaging Research Lab**](https://nirl.web.unc.edu/) at UNC Chapel Hill, focusing on **cognitive neuroscience**. I am particularly interested in **emotions, memory, and problem-solving**, utilizing neuroimaging techniques like **fMRI, EEG,**, and various physiological measures such as **ECG, PPG, and GSR** to investigate these cognitive processes. 

üß† **Current Project**  
I am involved in the [**STAARS project**](https://nirl.web.unc.edu/staars/) at UNC Chapel Hill, a large-scale, longitudinal study on the neurocognitive development of adolescents at risk for anxiety and depression. My work focuses on data collection and analysis, using the aforementioned techniques to explore the interplay between brain activity and physiological response in this population. 

üß† Previously, I conducted research across multiple labs:
- At the **Brain, Emotion, and Decision-Making Lab** with Dr. Nai-Shing Yen, I explored the **effects of color-emotion congruency on trust** and the impact of **gamification on motivation**.  
  üìç *<span style="color:gray;">National ChengChi University, Taiwan</span>*
- At the [**Brain and Learning Lab**](https://bnlnccu.wixsite.com/bnlnccu/home) under Dr. Ting-Ting Chang's supervision, I investigated **neural activation during math problem-solving**, gaining experience in conducting and analyzing fMRI experiments.   
  üìç *<span style="color:gray;">National ChengChi University, Taiwan</span>*
- In Dr. Hanna Steinunn Steingr√≠msd√≥ttir's **EEG lab**, I studied the **neural mechanisms of abstract symbol learning**, conducting EEG experiments on cognitive learning processes.   
  üìç *<span style="color:gray;">Reykjavik University, Iceland</span>*


üë©‚Äçüéì I obtained my bachelor's degree in Psychology in 2024 from [National ChengChi University](https://www.nccu.edu.tw/index.php?Lang=en), Taiwan, with a year of study abroad experience at [Reykjavik University](https://en.ru.is/), Iceland. 

üßù‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I am currently creating a [tutorial website](https://cocoyamo.github.io/R_tutorials/) for RStudio, focusing on data analysis and visualization. I'm also producing [instructional videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrnPgbLdSy7czQs7mrJNR9XQxH75OjvcU) to guide users step-by-step. My goal is to make learning RStudio more approachable and enjoyable.
