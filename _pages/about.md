🧠 My research interests are in cognitive neuroscience. I study emotions, memories, and problem-solving using measurements such as fMRI, EEG, EKG, and GSR.
- I have been working with Dr. Nai-Shing Yen at the Brain, Emotion, and Decision-Making Lab, studying the **effect of color and emotion congruency on trust** and the impact of gamification on motivation.
- I studied the difference in brain activation during **math problem solving** at [Brain and Learning Lab](https://bnlnccu.wixsite.com/bnlnccu/home) supervised by Dr. Ting-Ting Chang and am familiar with conducting fMRI experiments and analyzing fMRI data.
- I conducted EEG experiments, studying **abstract symbol learning process** at Dr. Hanna Steinunn Steingrímsdóttir's EEG lab.

👩‍🎓 I obtained my bachelor's degree in Psychology in 2024 from [National ChengChi University](https://www.nccu.edu.tw/index.php?Lang=en), Taiwan, with a year of study abroad experience at [Reykjavik University](https://en.ru.is/), Iceland. 

🧝‍♀️ I am currently creating a [tutorial website](https://cocoyamo.github.io/R_tutorials/) for RStudio, focusing on data analysis and visualization. I'm also producing instructional videos to guide users step-by-step. My goal is to make learning RStudio more approachable and enjoyable.
