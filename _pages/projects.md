# Make RStudio a friend, not a foe.

Welcome to [my RStudio tutorialðŸŽ‰](https://cocoyamo.github.io/R_tutorials/)! As a passionate data enthusiast, I created this tutorial for beginners and intermediate users to navigate the world of R programming confidently.

In this tutorial, you'll discover key topics like data import, cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis. You'll utilize popular tools and packages like **tidyverse** and **ggplot2**, transforming R from a source of frustration into a powerful ally in your data analysis journeyðŸª„.

By the end of the tutorial, you'll have the skills to perform effective data analysis and create compelling visualizations in R, enhancing your confidence and capabilities along the way.

# What does your brain look like while solving math problems?

`# math word problem` `# fronto-insular-parietal network` `# lexical consistency` `# fMRI` 


***"Tom has 6 books. Jerry has 10 books more than Tom. How many books does Jerry have?"*** This is a common math word problem where we apply abstract math operations to real-life situations.

However, when solving these problems, we often come across different ways of phrasing the same concept. For example, ***"Joe has 6 books. Amy has 2 books **less** than Joe. How many books does Joe have?"***

When the wording changes, the relationship between the numbers becomes harder to figure out.

We discovered a developmental shift, where children are more easily affected by lexical inconsistencies compared to adolescents. However, for adolescents, the consistency effect re-emerges when solving addition problems. This effect is evident in both their [brain](https://cocoyamo.github.io/publications/2024-04-15-age-related_differences_in_brain_responses_in_mathematical_problem-solving_among_children_and_adolescents)  and [behavioral](https://cocoyamo.github.io/publications/2022-10-15-development-of-operation-specific-lexical-consistency-effect-in-arithmetic-word-problem-solving) data.
