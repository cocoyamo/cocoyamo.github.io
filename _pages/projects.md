# Make RStudio a friend, not a foe.


Welcome to my RStudio tutorial üéâ! As a passionate data enthusiast, I created this tutorial to help beginners and intermediate users confidently dive into R programming.

üåê [Web Tutorial](https://cocoyamo.github.io/R_tutorials/): Covering key topics like data import, cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis using tidyverse and ggplot2.

üé• [Tutorial Videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrnPgbLdSy7czQs7mrJNR9XQxH75OjvcU): Boost your learning with step-by-step videos that make it easier to master R and turn it into a powerful ally ü™Ñ.

Latest video: Introduction to Tidyverse ü™ê

By the end, you'll have the skills to perform effective data analysis and create compelling visualizations, enhancing your confidence and abilities in R.



# What does your brain look like while solving math problems?

***"Tom has 6 books. Jerry has 10 books more than Tom. How many books does Jerry have?"*** This is a common math word problem where we apply abstract math operations to real-life situations.

However, when solving these problems, we often come across different ways of phrasing the same concept. For example, ***"Joe has 6 books. Amy has 2 books **less** than Joe. How many books does Joe have?"***

When the wording changes, the relationship between the numbers becomes harder to figure out.

We discovered a developmental shift, where children are more easily affected by lexical inconsistencies compared to adolescents. However, for adolescents, the consistency effect re-emerges when solving addition problems. This effect is evident in both their [brain](https://cocoyamo.github.io/publications/2024-04-15-age-related_differences_in_brain_responses_in_mathematical_problem-solving_among_children_and_adolescents)  and [behavioral](https://cocoyamo.github.io/publications/2022-10-15-development-of-operation-specific-lexical-consistency-effect-in-arithmetic-word-problem-solving) data.
