## What does your brain look like while solving math problems?

***"Tom has 6 books. Jerry has 10 books more than Tom. How many books does Jerry have?"*** This is a common math word problem where we apply abstract math operations to real-life situations.

However, when solving these problems, we often come across different ways of phrasing the same concept. For example, ***"Joe has 6 books. Amy has 2 books **less** than Joe. How many books does Joe have?"***

When the wording changes, the relationship between the numbers becomes harder to figure out.

We discovered a developmental shift, where children are more easily affected by lexical inconsistencies compared to adolescents. However, for adolescents, the consistency effect re-emerges when solving addition problems. This effect is evident in both their [brain](https://cocoyamo.github.io/publications/2024-04-15-age-related_differences_in_brain_responses_in_mathematical_problem-solving_among_children_and_adolescents)  and [behavioral](https://cocoyamo.github.io/publications/2022-10-15-development-of-operation-specific-lexical-consistency-effect-in-arithmetic-word-problem-solving) data.
